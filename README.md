# Exthereum Blockchain [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/exthereum/blockchain.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/exthereum/blockchain)

Elixir implementation of Ethereum's Blockchain. This includes functionality to build and verify a chain of Ethereum blocks that may be advertised from any peer. We complete the resultant state of the blocktree and form a canonical blockchain based on difficulty.

Exthereum's blocks are specified in a variety of sections throughout [the yellow paper](http://yellowpaper.io/), but it's best to start looking under Section 4.4.

## Installation

```bash
export "CFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib"
mix compile
```

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `blockchain` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:blockchain, "~> 0.1.6"}]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/blockchain](https://hexdocs.pm/blockchain).

## Debugging

To debug a given run of the blockchain, you can set breakpoints on contract addresses by setting the `BREAKPOINT` environment variable and specifying a contract address to break on. E.g.

```bash
BREAKPOINT=bc1ffc1620da1468624a596cb841d35e6b2f1fb6 iex -S mix

...

00:04:18.739 [warn]  Debugger has been enabled. Set breakpoint #1 on contract address 0xbc1ffc1620da1468624a596cb841d35e6b2f1fb6.
